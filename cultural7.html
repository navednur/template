			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>“It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.”
-Helen Keller</p>
			<p>It is clear to us that to change the society we have to change ourselves first. If we don’t see these issues as problems, it would just mean that we are not any different from animals. We have to address these as serious issues in our society. There are a billion people in the world who don’t get to eat three times a day. Millions of children’s don’t have any access to education. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are in serious need of help both physically and mentally. It is our bound duty as a human to help them.</p>
			<p>It is not that hard to reach up and help someone in need. It is as simple as smiling and being friendly.  It is as simple as listening or talking to someone, or donating something that you have less use for. Only by helping those who are in strain, we can make a huge change in our society. We can make this world a better place.</p>
