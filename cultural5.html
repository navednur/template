			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Union gives us strength. United we are like this bundle of sticks, which are really weak individually. But when bind together we become stronger to stand against strongest forces. We can face any challenges that thrown at us. We can offer our hands to people who need our help. We can help by volunteering or by working with them to propose a solution fits the best for the people in need. We can volunteer at the soup kitchens, halfway houses, hospice, and the nursing homes. Donations goes a long way too. We can donate the things we donâ€™t use, like- cloths, utensils, books, etc. We can also donate in different charities. Charities that focuses on major issues, such as- educating children, feeding the hunger, providing shelter, treating chronic diseases, etc. The micro-loan system was created by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Which is loaning a small amount of money to poor to start off and become self-sufficient. There are many organizations, which are loaning to the poor based on this fundamental theory. We can donate to these organizations to help the poor. We can express our love to people who are suffering from depression. Just by lending an ear to listen to them and understanding. We can also help by teaching other people about this problem. So they can learn about the situation and contribute to help. We can express our love to people who are suffering from depression. We can put ourselves in their shoes to understand their pain. It is not that difficult to help. Just a smile can go a long way.
