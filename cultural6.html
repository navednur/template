			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			
			<p>o	Change is society:</p>
			<p>It is inevitable that, when people in society work together to make society a better place for everyone, the society as we know it would change drastically. People who are helpless would get the proper help they deserve. They would have a better life, and they would be happy.  They would be able to contribute in the society. The understanding among people in our society would be much stronger.</p>
			
			<p>o	Increase in morality:</p>
			<p>If social activism takes place in our society, the morality among the people would increase a lot. People would be more sustain to distinguish between right and wrong. We would learn that it’s wrong to ignore and let down the people who are in need. Without the sense of helping the need, our morality might decrease.</p>
			
			<p>o	 World as a better place:</p>
			<p>Without hunger, chronic pain, and sadness, the world would be a much better place. People would be much happier. More and more kids would be able to receive education. People would not be deprived from basic human rights. Peace and tranquility would spread everywhere.</p>
			
			<p>o	Safer society:</p>
			<p>There is a noticeable coloration between crime and poverty. Crime rates are potentially high in poor areas. By helping people in need and by providing them the resources for creating an honest income for themselves would help them overcome poverty.  When we successfully lower the poverty in an area and statistically it becomes safer.</p>
			
			<p>o	Stronger social bond:</p>
			<p>Humans are social creature. Social bonding is what makes us civil. We create a society where we depend on each other. Where we share different chores of life to be better at what we are. We achieve perfection in our existence by bonding with one another.  By helping out the weak links of the community we can create much stronger society. </p>
			
			
			<p>o	Boost in Self-Esteem:</p>
			<p>Volunteering helps us feel better about ourselves. It makes us feel like- we matter in this society. When we see that our contribution is making a change, we feel proud of ourselves. This boost of self-esteem can go a long way. It enhances the sense of purpose in us. It takes our minds off worries and pressure that we face in day to day life. It results in our personal development.</p>
			
			<p>o	Better Understanding:</p>
			<p>Now a day we are invested in ourselves. We don’t apply ourselves to go about to understand what it is to like in others shoes. The world is totally different from different perspectives. When we connect and bond with one another, we start understanding the world better. The philosophy of equality and peace becomes much clearer. We can perceive the world in a very special spec. which is enriched with happiness.</p>
			
			<p>o	An Inspired new generation:</p>
			<p>Through the social movement we can expect to see an inspired new generation, who are eager to help out the society. This positive change they bring can be the example the upcoming generations rely on, to make the world a better place. </p>
			
			<p>o	Physical Benefits:</p>
			<p>Surprisingly doing good social work has remarkable health benefits to the participants. Studies show that it benefits both mental and physical health for the volunteers. A person who volunteers for a good social activity leads a much healthier life. They have lower mortality rate, also it lessens the various kinds of life threatening symptoms, such as- chronic diseases and heart-health.</p>
